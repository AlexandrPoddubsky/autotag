autotag
=======

Drupal fork of the autotag project, @see https://drupal.org/project/autotag.

I hope that this is a temporary fork. I would like to push this back to the autotag project.

Roadmap:

-Test support for other entities (taxonomy, etc.)

-Add ability to support fields other than body (this could be tricky). We want to support at least the title in addition to body. Some entities do not have access to the body field.
